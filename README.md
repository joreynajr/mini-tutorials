Improving my Linux/Python practice through mini-tutorials

This tutorial just encapsulate a lot of codes that can be thought of as Github Gists. Whenever I want to improve my understanding of some package or tool I often make a subdirectory with tutorials on some linux command or particular use of this command. I'll also include mini-tutorials from other languages as they come up.
